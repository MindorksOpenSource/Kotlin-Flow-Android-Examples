### This project is for: 
* Who wants to learn Kotlin Flow

### Just Build the project and start learning Flow by examples.
If you want to get started with Kotlin Flow, [checkout the blog](https://blog.mindorks.com/what-is-flow-in-kotlin-and-how-to-use-it-in-android-project)

# Kotlin Flow Operators Examples present in this sample project
* `Filter` -> Returns a flow containing only values of the original flow that matches the given condition
* `Zip` -> Zips values from the current flow with another flow
* `FilterIsInstance` ->  Returns a flow containing only values that are instances of specified data type
* `FilterNot` -> Returns a flow containing only values of the original flow that do not match the given condition
* `FilterNotNull` -> Returns a flow containing only values of the original flow that are not null.
* `FlatMapConcat` -> Transforms the flow and then concatenating and flattening these flows.
* `FlatMapLatest` -> Transforms the flow and then flattening last flows
* `FlatMapMerge` -> Transforms elements emitted by the original flow, that returns another flow, and then merging and flattening these flows.
* `FlattenConcat` -> Flattens the given flow of flows into a single flow
* `DistinctUntilChanged` -> suppress duplicate items emitted
* `FlattenMerge` -> Flattens the given flow of flows into a single flow with alimit on the number of concurrently collected flows.
* `Map` ->  Returns a flow containing the results of applying the given condition
* `Merge` ->  Merges the given flows into a single flow without preserving an order of elements.
* `OnCompletion` -> Invokes it when the given flow is completed or cancelled
* `OnStart` -> Invokes it when the given flow is started
* `ScanReduce` -> Reduces the given flow with give condition, emitting every intermediate result, including initial value
* `TransformLatest` ->  Transforms the last item collected from flow
