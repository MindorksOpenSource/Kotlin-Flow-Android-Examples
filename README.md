## About this project: 
* If you want to get started with Kotlin Flow, then this project is for you.
* Common use-cases of Kotlin Flow in Android has been implemented in this project.
* This is your one-stop solution for learning Kotlin Flow for Android Development.

## Steps to learn Kotlin Flow by examples from this project
* First, learn the concepts of Kotlin Flow from this **[blog](https://blog.mindorks.com/what-is-flow-in-kotlin-and-how-to-use-it-in-android-project)**
* Understanding Terminal Operators in Kotlin Flow. [Learn from here](https://blog.mindorks.com/terminal-operators-in-kotlin-flow)
* Then, just clone, build, run the project and start learning Kotlin Flow by examples.

## This Kotlin Flow Example Project will help you in learning the following for Android App Development:
* What is Kotlin Flow?
* How to use Kotlin Flow in Android?
* Step by Step guide on how to implement the Kotlin flow in Android?
* Doing simple task in Kotlin Flow
* Using operators like filter, map, reduce, flatMapConcat, zip, and etc.
* Exception in Kotlin Flow
* How to use onCompletion in Flow?
* Using Kotlin Flow with Retrofit.
* Using Kotlin Flow with Room Database.
* Making two network calls in parallel using Kotlin Flow.
* Doing task in series using Kotlin Flow.
* Unit test in Flow.

### Kotlin Flow Examples for Android Development:
* **Single Network Call:**  Learn how to make a network call using Kotlin Flow. This is a very simple use-case in Android App Development.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/single/SingleNetworkCallViewModel.kt)
 
* **Series Network Call:**  Learn how to make network calls in series using Kotlin Flow. This is useful when you want to make a network call which is dependent on an another network call.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/series/SeriesNetworkCallsActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/series/SeriesNetworkCallsViewModel.kt)

* **Parallel Network Call:**  Learn how to make network calls in parallel using Kotlin Flow. This is useful when you want to make a network call which is dependent on an another network call.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/parallel/ParallelNetworkCallsActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/retrofit/parallel/ParallelNetworkCallsViewModel.kt)

* **Room Database Operation:** Learn how to fetch or insert entity in database using Kotlin Flow. This is useful when you are using Room Database in your Android Application.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/room/RoomDBActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/room/RoomDBViewModel.kt) 

* **Long Running Task:** Learn how to do a long running task using Kotlin Flow. If you want to do any of your task in background thread using the Kotlin Flow, then this is useful.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/task/onetask/LongRunningTaskActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/task/onetask/LongRunningTaskViewModel.kt) 
    
* **Two Long Running Tasks:** Learn how to run two long running tasks in parallel using Kotlin Flow.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/task/twotasks/TwoLongRunningTasksActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/task/twotasks/TwoLongRunningTasksViewModel.kt)     

* **Catch Error Handling:** Learn how to handle error in Kotlin Flow using Catch.
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/errorhandling/catch/CatchActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/errorhandling/catch/CatchViewModel.kt) 
       
* **Completion:**
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/completion/CompletionActivity.kt)

* **Reduce:**
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/reduce/ReduceActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/reduce/ReduceViewModel.kt)    
      
* **Map:**
    * [Activity Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/map/MapActivity.kt)
    * [ViewModel Code](app/src/main/java/com/mindorks/kotlinFlow/learn/map/MapViewModel.kt)    
      
* **Filter:**
